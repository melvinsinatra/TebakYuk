# TebakYuk
TebakYuk is a number guessing game, made with Java Swing. There are 10 buttons present in the application. Each button will be assigned a random Integer value, but the value will be hidden from the user. The Integer value are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. There are 2 of every Integer value present within the buttons. If the user clicked a button, the button will reveal its Integer value. The user must continuously guess the same number by pressing the buttons. There will be 10 starting attempts, and if the user guesses the wrong numbers, the attempt will reduce by 1. If the user has 0 attempts left, the game will restart by re-randomizing the buttonsâ€™ Integer value again, and also giving the user 10 attempts again. The user will win the game if they could correctly guessed all the Integer value of each button.
